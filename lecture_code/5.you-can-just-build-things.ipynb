Chances are, it’s the biggest commitment of time, energy, and money that you’ve ever made. A Fordham education doesn’t just help you navigate today’s challenges. It will help you learn to anticipate what’s next.\\n\\nThe simple fact is graduates with four-year degrees earn nearly twice as much as non-grads, according to *The New York Times*. And the gap’s getting bigger.\\n\\nSo we’re here to help you take advantage of these undeniable advantages. Let’s work on making this possible.\\n\\nTuition and Cost of Attendance\\n\\nTuition is one component of the total cost of attendance (COA). Tuition specifically covers the cost of academic instruction, while the COA consists of standard school expenses (tuition, fees, and books) and an estimate of a student’s standard living expenses (housing, food, transportation, and other miscellaneous expenses). Each student’s financial needs are different, so the estimated COA may be less depending on the student’s circumstances.\\n\\n**Undergraduate Tuition and Costs of Attendance**\\n\\n[Gabelli School of Business](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/undergraduate-tuition/gabelli-school-of-business/)[Fordham College at Lincoln Center](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/undergraduate-tuition/fordham-college-at-lincoln-center/)[Fordham College at Rose Hill](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/undergraduate-tuition/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/)[School of Professional and Continuing Studies](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/undergraduate-tuition/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/)\\n\\n![Rose Hill Students Walking](/media/home/commonly-used-images/campus-beauty/KGamble-20111003-1051.jpg'},\n",

GT makes it possible for international students to connect with other people and form a group that in which people understand and support each other. I came here to study almost with no idea about how I should live the life here. It's GT that made me know basic stuff like where to shop and how to take the public transportation ; help me learn more about the school, culture, community here. It also let me meet some people very nice and helpful like my GTA. My transition would be less smooth without the gain from the GT program.”\\n- “Looking back, GT was a very valuable experience for me because I don’t think I would have met the friends that I know today without that 5-day program. More importantly, the GTAs that I’ve met and still keep in touch with during the global transition have been such a great help for me throughout my first year\"},\n",

A video is considered active as long as someone (whether the owner or a viewer) has accessed it. Storage on Panopto is limited by the amount of time it exists without being accessed, as opposed to space.**For videos that are meeting recordings ported over from Zoom:**\\n\\nIf no one accesses the video, it remains available for 24 months.\\n\\nAfter that, it remains in a recycle bin for 3 months.\\n\\nIf the owner does not restore it from the recycle bin, it is automatically deleted.**For all other videos:**\\n\\nIf no one accesses the video, it remains available for 20 months.\\n\\nAfter that, it remains in an archive for 10 months.\\n\\nIf the owner does not restore it from the archive, it is automatically deleted.\\n\\nWatching your Panopto content resets its retention clock, so active files remain on the system. To keep content on Panopto, it needs to stay active by being viewed regularly.\\n\\n## How to Connect\\n\\nAccess Panopto from Blackboard, or My Apps on the Portal at fordham.edu, or at [Fordham.hosted.panopto.com](http://fordham.hosted.panopto.com/). Consult Panopto's support pages for [system requirements](https://support.panopto.com/s/article/System-Requirements).\\n\\n## Features\\n\\nPanopto provides robust editing and accessibility services. Use the Blackboard integration to embed videos in your Blackboard courses.\\n\\n**Zoom recordings**\\n\\nWhen you record an online meeting to the cloud using your [Fordham Zoom account](http://fordham.zoom.us/), the recording is automatically sent to the Meeting Record\"},\n",

Panopto is *not* a replacement for a live [Zoom](/information-technology/standard-software/virtual-classes-and-meetings/zoom-services/) meeting for a synchronous class. See [fordham.edu/zoom](/information-technology/standard-software/virtual-classes-and-meetings/zoom-services/) for more information.\\n\\n**Accessibility**\\n\\nPanopto prioritizes accessibility and inclusivity in educational content delivery. It offers robust sharing capabilities, allowing users to distribute videos within the university network or publicly through customizable permission settings. Content can be easily integrated into various platforms, including websites, learning management systems (like Blackboard), or shared via direct links.\\n\\nKey accessibility features of Panopto include:\\n\\n- Automatic closed captioning: Generates accurate subtitles for audio and video content, making it accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing users.\\n- Searchable transcripts: Provides full-text transcripts, enabling users to search for specific content within videos and improving comprehension for all learners.\\n- Screen reader compatibility: Ensures that the Panopto interface and video player are navigable using assistive technologies.\\n- Keyboard navigation: Allows users to control video playback and access features without relying on a mouse.\\n- Customizable playback: Offers options to adjust video speed and toggle visual elements, accommodating different learning preferences and needs.\\n- Multi-language support: Facilitates the creation of captions and transcripts in multiple languages, broadening accessibility for diverse audiences.\\n\\nAdditionally, Panopto provides detailed analytics on video usage, including viewer engagement, watch time, and interaction metrics.

Understanding how people with disabilities use the web helps us create digital spaces that meet diverse needs. Learn more about the [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).\\n\\nAs digital engagement has become an integral part of life at Fordham — from applying to the University, to registering for classes, to showcasing research — accessibility remains a top priority.

MFA is simple: When you log in with your password, you will receive an identity authentication request on a secondary device such as a smartphone, cell phone, tablet, computer, or landline to finish the login process. Fordham’s MFA service is provided by Duo Security, a trusted company used by many higher education institutions.\\n\\nVerifying your identity using MFA reduces the risk associated with unauthorized access to your accounts, should your passwords ever be compromised.\\n\\nIf you need assistance with any aspect of MFA, please contact the [IT Service Desk](/information-technology/it-services/technology-support/).\\n\\nView the [Multi-Factor Authentication Policy](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/multi-factor-authentication-policy/) for more information.\\n\\n## How to Use MFA\\n\\n-\\n### How MFA Works\\n\\n- Enter your\\n[username and password](/information-technology/it-services/fordham-username/)to log in to a Fordham system. - If MFA is required, you will be automatically redirected to an MFA login screen that prompts you to verify your identity on your secondary device.\\n- Use your secondary device to verify the login and gain access.\\n\\n##### 💡Tip: Remember Duo MFA Identity Verification for 30 Days💡\\n\\nYou can\\n\\nopt to have Duo remember you, allowing you to skip MFA when logging in on the same browser and device for the next 30 days.

Contact the IT Service Desk at 718-817-3999 to retrieve the code.#### Can I complete MFA if I am travelling internationally?\\n\\nMFA works anywhere in the world.

Duo does not have access to your Fordham password.\\n\\n#### Why does Duo Mobile need access to my device’s camera?\\n\\nDuo Mobile needs one-time access to your device’s camera. Duo Mobile only accesses your camera when it scans a QR code during activation. This step is only completed during your initial enrollment or when you elect to activate a new smartphone.

The students and faculty who started the Bronx COVID-19 Oral History Project have conducted over 20 interviews and highlighted Bronx small businesses.\\n\\n### Oral Histories Digital Archive Open to the Public\\n\\nWe have captured the stories of hundreds of Bronx African Americans who have transformed the borough’s character since the 1930s. Consisting of downloadable audio files and verbatim transcripts of interviews conducted from 2002 to 2013, they are available to the public in a new digital archive.\\n\\n### Scholarship and Community\\n\\nWe hope our work will be of use to scholars, students, teachers, public historians, and museum curators who are doing research on people of African descent in New York City or general scholarship on the social development of 20th century American cities. We continue to identify, preserve, catalog, and make accessible archival record collections relating to the history of people of African descent in The Bronx.\\n\\nWe also produce scholarly publications and teaching tools that contribute to the fields of African American studies, African diaspora studies, Urban History, and Sociology.\\n\\nBy building partnerships between Fordham University, the [Bronx County Historical Society'},\n",

Once an incident is reported, if they wish, students can be connected with support from other staff and offices in the University, including Residential Life, Multicultural Affairs, Vice President for Equity & Inclusion, Counseling and Psychological Services and Campus Ministry among others. It is important to keep in mind that Fordham will respond in a way that protects your privacy and preferences for next steps. However, Public Safety may be required for legal or safety reasons ask to interview you and conduct an investigation in conjunction with the Dean of Students. The Department of Public Safety sends the completed incident report to the campus Dean of Students as it may need to be handled in the University’s student conduct process.

Clinical staff in Counseling and Psychological Services and pastoral counselors in Campus Ministry can help privately and are not obligated to report incidents unless there is an imminent threat to safety.

Fordham University encourages any student who is the victim of an alleged crime to notify the Department of Public Safety immediately and to work with them to report the alleged crime to local law enforcement. In certain cases, the University is required by statute to notify local law enforcement. Students always have the right to report any alleged crime to law enforcement directly.\\n\\n**Do other people have to know about the incident?**\\n\\nSome bias and discrimination incidents are more public than others. For example, awareness in the community of a bias-related vandalism incident may be more widespread than a private incident between two individuals. The University will make every reasonable effort to respond sensitively to your report and will work to assure that the community is not made aware of an interpersonal incident that the complainant wishes keep private. Investigations coordinated by the Department of Public Safety and the Dean of Students office will proceed with measures to protect your privacy and that of the parties involved during any investigation.

These events are designed to provide you with valuable information and opportunities to connect with other Fordham families and members of the faculty and staff, creating a supportive network that extends far beyond campus.\\n\\nIn the coming months, you'll have the chance to experience firsthand the spirit of Fordham – a community grounded in Jesuit values, academic excellence, and a commitment to service. From exploring the vibrant neighborhoods of New York City to cheering on the Rams at athletic events and theater performances, there's no shortage of opportunities for you and your family to make lasting memories together.\\n\\nTo help kickstart your Fordham journey, we've included some dates to keep in mind for the year as well as a checklist of items for your student to complete before opening day.

GT makes it possible for international students to connect with other people and form a group that in which people understand and support each other. I came here to study almost with no idea about how I should live the life here. It's GT that made me know basic stuff like where to shop and how to take the public transportation ; help me learn more about the school, culture, community here. It also let me meet some people very nice and helpful like my GTA. My transition would be less smooth without the gain from the GT program.”\\n- “Looking back, GT was a very valuable experience for me because I don’t think I would have met the friends that I know today without that 5-day program. More importantly, the GTAs that I’ve met and still keep in touch with during the global transition have been such a great help for me throughout my first year\"},\n",

A video is considered active as long as someone (whether the owner or a viewer) has accessed it. Storage on Panopto is limited by the amount of time it exists without being accessed, as opposed to space.**For videos that are meeting recordings ported over from Zoom:**\\n\\nIf no one accesses the video, it remains available for 24 months.\\n\\nAfter that, it remains in a recycle bin for 3 months.\\n\\nIf the owner does not restore it from the recycle bin, it is automatically deleted.**For all other videos:**\\n\\nIf no one accesses the video, it remains available for 20 months.\\n\\nAfter that, it remains in an archive for 10 months.\\n\\nIf the owner does not restore it from the archive, it is automatically deleted.\\n\\nWatching your Panopto content resets its retention clock, so active files remain on the system. To keep content on Panopto, it needs to stay active by being viewed regularly.\\n\\n## How to Connect\\n\\nAccess Panopto from Blackboard, or My Apps on the Portal at fordham.edu, or at [Fordham.hosted.panopto.com](http://fordham.hosted.panopto.com/).

MFA is simple: When you log in with your password, you will receive an identity authentication request on a secondary device such as a smartphone, cell phone, tablet, computer, or landline to finish the login process. Fordham’s MFA service is provided by Duo Security, a trusted company used by many higher education institutions.\\n\\nVerifying your identity using MFA reduces the risk associated with unauthorized access to your accounts, should your passwords ever be compromised.\\n\\nIf you need assistance with any aspect of MFA, please contact the [IT Service Desk](/information-technology/it-services/technology-support/).\\n\\nView the [Multi-Factor Authentication Policy](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/multi-factor-authentication-policy/) for more information.\\n\\n## How to Use MFA\\n\\n-\\n### How MFA Works\\n\\n- Enter your\\n[username and password](/information-technology/it-services/fordham-username/)to log in to a Fordham system. - If MFA is required, you will be automatically redirected to an MFA login screen that prompts you to verify your identity on your secondary device.\\n- Use your secondary device to verify the login and gain access.\\n\\n##### 💡Tip: Remember Duo MFA Identity Verification for 30 Days💡\\n\\nYou can\\n\\nopt to have Duo remember you, allowing you to skip MFA when logging in on the same browser and device for the next 30 days.

Contact the IT Service Desk at 718-817-3999 to retrieve the code.#### Can I complete MFA if I am travelling internationally?\\n\\nMFA works anywhere in the world. If you are travelling without a telephone signal or data plan, you can use the Duo Mobile app passcode. Just ensure your device is already set up with the Duo Mobile app before you travel. If you use the app, tap the key icon in the “Fordham University” bar to generate the required six-digit passcode without a telephone signal or data plan. You can do this anywhere in the world.\\n\\n#### What information is shared with Duo Security?\\n\\nDuo only stores your Fordham username, email address, and authentication device information, such as your phone number. Duo does not have access to your Fordham password.\\n\\n#### Why does Duo Mobile need access to my device’s camera?\\n\\nDuo Mobile needs one-time access to your device’s camera. Duo Mobile only accesses your camera when it scans a QR code during activation. This step is only completed during your initial enrollment or when you elect to activate a new smartphone. You may disable Duo’s camera access in your phone’s settings; enable it only if you need it again.\\n\\n- Go to fordham.edu and click\\n\\n## Device Authentication Methods\\n\\n-\\n### Duo Mobile Push Notification\\n\\n\\nWhen you try to log in, you will receive a\\n\\n**push notification**from the Duo Mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duo-mobile/id422663827)/[Android](https://play\"},\n",

Policy Statement\\n\\nFordham University is a highly collaborative workplace. It provides robust on-campus experiences that are the hallmark of a transformational Jesuit education and a dynamic environment for students, faculty, staff and administrators. While on-campus work is preferred, a hybrid work arrangement and, rarely, a fully remote work arrangement can create advantages for both the University and its employees. Such advantages may include increased productivity and performance, relief of on-campus space constraints, enhanced employee recruitment and retention, cost reduction, environmental sustainability, crisis response, greater work-life balance, and increased job satisfaction.\\n\\n[2.

Clinical staff in Counseling and Psychological Services and pastoral counselors in Campus Ministry can help privately and are not obligated to report incidents unless there is an imminent threat to safety.

Fordham University encourages any student who is the victim of an alleged crime to notify the Department of Public Safety immediately and to work with them to report the alleged crime to local law enforcement. In certain cases, the University is required by statute to notify local law enforcement.

As your student starts their first year, we understand the mix of emotions that come with this transition, and we're here to support you every step of the way.\\n\\nOur daughter Lucy is beginning her junior year at Lincoln Center and coming from Texas, the transition to having her so far away was difficult at the start. We recognize the importance of feeling connected and informed, especially during this time of change. That's why we encourage you to take advantage of the resources available to you, from our Summer Orientation programs on campus to Summer Send Offs around the country. These events are designed to provide you with valuable information and opportunities to connect with other Fordham families and members of the faculty and staff, creating a supportive network that extends far beyond campus.\\n\\nIn the coming months, you'll have the chance to experience firsthand the spirit of Fordham – a community grounded in Jesuit values, academic excellence, and a commitment to service. From exploring the vibrant neighborhoods of New York City to cheering on the Rams at athletic events and theater performances, there's no shortage of opportunities for you and your family to make lasting memories together.\\n\\nTo help kickstart your Fordham journey, we've included some dates to keep in mind for the year as well as a checklist of items for your student to complete before opening day. Additionally, we’ve included a Fordham Family decal to display proudly. We hope these tokens serve as a reminder of the exciting adventures\"},\n",

The church lawn is flooded with presiding Jesuits, faculty, administration, nervous parents, and excited new freshmen. Each year, the Fordham Choir begins the celebration by singing \"All Are Welcome.\" All Are Welcome symbolizes why the Fordham community is such a wonderful and special place. For our family, it was at that very moment we knew we were among friends and found a second home. It is this spirit of Fordham and its people that curate this ever-welcoming community.\\n\\nThroughout our time as Fordham parents, we have strived to find ways to become more active in this community, support the Fordham mission and the student body. Joining the Parents’ Leadership Council (PLC) has allowed us to expand our relationships and deepen our connections to the Fordham community. The PLC is the perfect platform for parents who want to lead, serve, and give back to Fordham.\\n\\nWe would be honored if you would consider joining the PLC.
