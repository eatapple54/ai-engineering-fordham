    "\n",
    "- **ChatGPT / Claude** - Ask AI to explain concepts or help debug\n",
    "- **Google** - Search for tutorials and documentation\n",
    "- **Cursor AI** - Use `Cmd+L` / `Ctrl+L` to ask questions in your editor\n",
    "- **Stack Overflow** - A great resource for programming questions\n",
